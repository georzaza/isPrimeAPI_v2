commom threads and daemon threads.
programs waits for common threads to end before it shuts down.
However, daemon threads will get killed when the program exits.
If they are killed forcefully, then the rest of/part of the code they were executing will never execute.

threading._shutdown()  -->  walks through all of the running threads and calls .join() on every one that does not have the daemon flag set.

CREATE A DAEMON THREAD
x = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(1,), daemon=True)


Some possible structure of the code would be:


# ask user for mcast group through args. If None, then use some default.

# start a thread of the api after getting the mcast groups to join.
# the thread will register as a service and from then and on forward 
# it should be able to handle any request making use of the 


# somehow, when a new request gets to the api, 
# the api should tell this app if this is a request to calc a prime.
# If yes, then
#   this app should start a new thread for listening to new connections
#   UNLESS it has already started 3 threads.

# The api should handle all the communication needed 
# example: it should send an ack if and when this app receives a prime-calc
# request. 
#
# This app is responsible for calculating if the number is prime.
#
# When and after this app calculates whether the number is prime, 
# it must use sendReply to the api with the response.
