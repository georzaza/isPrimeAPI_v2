ALL OF THE BELOW were tested only on Linux with python version 3.9 installed. 

The setup.py file can be used to install the api globally 
To do so, go to the folder where the setup.py is and execute the following command:

`python setup.py bdist_wheel`

Among others, this will create a dist folder containing the required .whl file.
Having now this .whl file, executing the following command will install the api globally.

`pip install /path/to/wheelfile.whl`


The file api_is_prime/__init__.py file contains the code that will be executed when we
import the api. To be more clear:

The above procedure made the "api_is_prime" module globally available.
To import we simply need to write:
`import api_is_prime`

When the above command is executed, the code that resides into the file 
"api_is_prime/__init__.py" will be executed.


To uninstall just enter the command `pip uninstall api_is_prime` as with any module.
