0.  This how-to assumes that the application folder is located in your
    home directory !!! If not, change the command appended to your .bashrc file.

1.  open the file '.bashrc' with an editor.    `nano ~/.bashrc`
    If you dont use bash but eg. zsh, then the name of the file will be .zshrc

3.  add this command at the end of the file 
    alias install_api="echo 'Trying to run setup.py located in Desktop/distr/isPrimeAPI' && echo ''  && python ~/Desktop/distr/isPrimeAPI/setup.py bdist_wheel  && echo '' && echo '' && echo 'Trying to install the library globally now' && echo '' && pip install ~/Desktop/distr/isPrimeAPI/dist/api_is_prime-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl "

4.  restart your terminal.

5.  Run the command `install_api`. If it's not working, see step 2 subsection.
