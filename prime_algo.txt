The long data type can store whole numbers from
-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. 

This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. 
Note that you should end the value with an "L":


long myNum = 15000000000L;


if last bit is zero, then it's an even number => return false

convert binary to string and check with regex (0|(10|11(01)*(00|1))(01*0(01)*(00|1))*1)* .
this will answer the question if the number is a multiple of 5. 
if it is, return false.
This regex also checks whether the decimal number ends in 0, so it is a double check 
that we do for numbers that are even and end in 0, but it's ok since this will save 
us a lot of iterations if the number is large.



We now can exclude numbers that end in 5 since all these numbers are multiples of 5

This saves us floor( sqrt(number)/5) iterations.
For example if we wanted to check whether 12349 is a a prime, we would need
111/5 = 22 less iterations.
But if we wanted to check whether 9223372036854775 is a prime we would need 
96038388/5 = 19207677 less iterations.
